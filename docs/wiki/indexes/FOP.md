### Introduction

The FOP method is based on the proportion of optimal codons to a gene's total number of codons.

It is calculated as the gene's ratio of optimal codons to synonymous codons.

### How to calculate?

The ratio of optimal codons number to the total number of codons (both optimal and non-optimal) provides the Fop index.

### Meaning of value

It is essential to understand that the Fop index is context-dependent as values rely on the genetic code of the particular species. Because the genetic code is not perfectively universal, the Fop index may not universally apply across species.
