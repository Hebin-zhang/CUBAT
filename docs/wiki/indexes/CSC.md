### Introduction

To determine whether mRNAs enriched in any individual codon demonstrated greater or lesser stability.

For each codon, calculated a correlation between the frequency of occurrence of that codon in mRNAs and the stabilities of the mRNAs. This metric is the codon occurrence to mRNA stability correlation coefficient (CSC).

### How to calculate?

A codon's occurrence was compared to the half-life for each mRNA, and use Pearson correlation calculation to generate an R-value.

### Meaning of value

CSC showed the relationship between each codon and mRNA stability
